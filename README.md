# TKIN
This is for our paper "[Exploring Kernel-based Texture Transfer for Pose-guided Person Image Generation](10.1109/TMM.2022.3221351)" which is accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia(TMM).
# Requirement
```
conda create -n tkin python=3.6
conda install pytorch=1.2 cudatoolkit=10.0 torchvision
pip install scikit-image pillow pandas tqdm dominate natsort 
```
# Data
Data preparation for images , keypoints and parsing maps can follow [PISE](https://github.com/Zhangjinso/PISE),which is based on the DeepFashion-inshop dataset.
Additionally, [DTD dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/dtd) if needed can be download from [baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11HTqi2esY9nMorzcSi1qkg)(fectch code: 4z7r)
